  Project - Philosophers
</h1>

The "Philosophers" project focuses on the basics of threading processes and introduces concepts such as mutexes. It simulates a scenario where philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping at a round table with a limited number of forks. The goal is to prevent starvation while ensuring no data races occur in the implementation. The mandatory part involves creating a threaded version where each philosopher is represented as a thread. Strict coding guidelines must be followed to handle various scenarios effectively.
